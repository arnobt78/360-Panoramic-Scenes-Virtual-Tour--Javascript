## Project Summary

This project is a browser-based 360° virtual tour as brain tree web application. It allows users to explore panoramic scenes, navigate between different rooms or areas, and interact with hotspots for information or navigation. The app is built using [Marzipano](https://www.marzipano.net/), a 360° media viewer library, and is fully client-side, requiring no backend server.

- **Live Demo:** [https://braintree-virtual-tour.netlify.app/](https://braintree-virtual-tour.netlify.app/)

├── data.js              # Scene and hotspot configuration (JSON)
├── index.html           # Main HTML file

```

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript**: Core web technologies
- **[Marzipano](https://www.marzipano.net/)**: 360° panorama viewer
- **Bowser**: Browser detection
- **Screenfull**: Fullscreen API wrapper
- **Eric Meyer's Reset CSS**: CSS reset for cross-browser consistency

---

## How It Works

- The app loads scene and hotspot data from `data.js`.
- `index.html` provides the UI structure, including the panorama container, scene list, and controls.
- `index.js` initializes Marzipano, loads scenes, sets up navigation and info hotspots, and manages UI interactions (fullscreen, autorotate, etc).
- Panoramic images are stored in the `tiles/` directory, organized by scene and resolution level.
- The UI is styled via `style.css` and uses icons from the `img/` folder.

---

## How to Run

1. **Clone or download the repository.**
2. **Start a local HTTP server in the project directory:**
   - With Python 3:

     ```sh
     python3 -m http.server 8000
     ```

   - With Python 2:

     ```sh
     python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
     ```

3. **Open your browser and go to:**
   [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Component & API Walkthrough

### 1. `data.js`

- Contains a global `APP_DATA` object with all scene definitions, levels, initial view parameters, and hotspot data.
- Each scene has:
  - `id`, `name`, `levels` (tile resolutions), `faceSize`, `initialViewParameters`, `linkHotspots`, `infoHotspots`.

### 2. `index.html`

- Loads all scripts and styles.
- Contains UI elements: panorama container (`#pano`), scene list, title bar, control buttons.

### 3. `index.js`

- Initializes Marzipano viewer and loads scenes from `APP_DATA`.
- Sets up navigation and info hotspots.
- Handles UI events: scene switching, autorotate, fullscreen, view controls.
- Responsive: switches between desktop and mobile layouts.

### 4. `style.css`

- Styles for layout, controls, scene list, hotspots, and responsive design.

### 5. `vendor/`

- `marzipano.js`: 360° viewer library
- `bowser.min.js`: Browser detection
- `screenfull.min.js`: Fullscreen API
- `reset.min.css`: CSS reset

### 6. `tiles/`

- Contains subfolders for each scene (e.g., `0-entrance/`), each with preview and tiled images for multiple resolutions and cube faces.

### 7. `img/`

- UI icons for controls and hotspots (e.g., play, pause, fullscreen, info, arrows).

---

## Reusing Components

- **Marzipano Integration**: You can reuse the Marzipano setup (`index.js`) in other projects by providing your own `data.js` and image tiles.
- **Hotspot Logic**: The functions for creating link and info hotspots are modular and can be adapted for other interactive 360° viewers.
- **UI Controls**: The control logic (autorotate, fullscreen, view movement) is generic and can be ported to similar projects.

---

## Example Usage

To add a new scene:

1. Add a new folder in `tiles/` with the required image tiles and a `preview.jpg`.
2. Add a new scene object in `data.js` with the correct `id`, `name`, and parameters.
3. Add a new entry in the scene list in `index.html`.

To add a hotspot:

- Add a `linkHotspot` or `infoHotspot` entry in the relevant scene in `data.js`.

## Conclusion

This project is a robust template for building interactive 360° virtual tours on the web. It is easy to extend with new scenes, hotspots, and UI customizations. Perfect for real estate, education, museums, or any scenario requiring immersive navigation.
